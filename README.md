## Project Report
    I found this project very interesting and fun. Learning how the interactions between objects and how the physics engine works was really neat. One thing I struggled a little bit with was being able to aim the ball in a direction and have an amount of power be determined as well. I don't think I ended up doing it in the prettiest and best way possible but I was glad when I was able to figure it out. I'm hoping the rest of this project helps me learn more new things so I can create things like this more freely in teh future.

- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [X] D-2: The repository contains, in the top-level directory, a <code>README.md</code> file that includes the project identifier and author's name.
- [X] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [X] C-2: The repository is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as normal for each change made to the minor version. The link submitted on Canvas is to the relevant release.

- [X] C-5: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [X] C-6: The player can fire the projectile.
- [X] C-7: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [X] C-8: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [X] C-9: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration as well as the reflections from previous iterations, if any.
- [X] B-2: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a self-assessment.
- [X] B-3: The release is published to GitHub Pages with a link provided in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] B-4: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [X] B-5: Once fired, the projectile is non-interactive.
